# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and tidying data from the UCI HAR Dataset. The output is a tidy dataset `tidy_data.txt`, which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files
- `run_analysis.R`: The R script for processing the raw data into a tidy dataset.
- `tidy_data.txt`: The final tidy dataset.
- `CodeBook.md`: Explains the variables, transformations, and summaries in the tidy dataset.

## How to use it

Run source("run_analysis.R") to generate the tidy_data.txt file
